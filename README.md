# Vigenere-Cipher-Decoder-Tool

A Vigenère cipher decoder tool that uses frequency analysis to display the most likely letters used at each index of the Vigenère encryption key.
The correct key length must be provided. 

Future implementations will allow the user to enter the ciphertext and key length, and try keys for decryption, through the console.
